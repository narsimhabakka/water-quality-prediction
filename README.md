WATER QUALLITY PREDICTION

in the given project we use machine learning algorithms and python to prediction the water is drinkable or not
for that we collect the data of water from various places which consists of hardness, sodium, phospherous, PH, minerals values and use machine learning algorithms to manipulate and process the data.
